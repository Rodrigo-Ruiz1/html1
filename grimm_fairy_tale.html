        <p> Two or three hundred years ago, when people were far from being so
            crafty and cunning as they are nowadays, an extraordinary event
            took place in a little town.  By some mischance one of the great
            owls, called horned owls, had come from the neighboring woods into
            the barn of one of the townsfolk in the night-time, and when day
            broke did not dare to venture forth again from her retreat, for
            fear of the other birds, which raised a terrible outcry whenever
            she appeared.

        <p> In the morning when the man-servant went into the
            barn to fetch some straw, he was so mightily alarmed at the sight
            of the owl sitting there in a corner, that he ran away and
            announced to his master that a monster, the like of which he had
            never set eyes on in his life, and which could devour a man
            without the slightest difficulty, was sitting in the barn, rolling
            its eyes about in its head.  I know your kind, said the master,
            you have courage enough to chase a blackbird about the fields, but
            when you see a hen lying dead, you have to get a stick before you
            go near it.  I must go and see for myself what kind of a monster
            it is, added the master, and went quite boldly into the granary
            and looked round him.  When, however, he saw with his own eyes
            the strange grim creature, he was no less terrified than the
            servant had been.  With two bounds he sprang out, ran to his
            neighbours, and begged them imploringly to lend him assistance
            against an unknown and dangerous beast, or else the whole town
            might be in danger if it
            were to break loose out of the barn, where it was shut up.

        <p> A great noise and clamor arose in all the streets, the townsmen
            came armed with spears, hay-forks, scythes, and axes, as if they
            were going out against an enemy.  Finally, the senators appeared
            with the burgomaster at their head.  When they had drawn up in
            the market-place, they marched to the barn, and surrounded it on
            all sides.  Thereupon one of the most courageous of them stepped
            forth and entered with his spear lowered, but came running out
            immediately afterwards with a shriek and as pale as death, and
            could not utter a single word.  Yet two others ventured in, but
            they fared no better.  At last one stepped forth, a great strong
            man who was famous for his warlike deeds, and said, you will not
            drive away the monster by merely looking at him, we must be in
            earnest here, but I see that you have all tuned into women, and
            not one of you dares to encounter the animal.  He ordered them
            to give him some armor, had a sword and spear brought, and armed
            himself.</p>
        <p> All praised his courage, though many feared for his
            life.  The two barn-doors were opened, and they saw the owl, which
            in the meantime had perched herself on the middle of a great
            cross-beam.  He had a ladder brought, and when he raised it, and
            made ready to climb up, they all cried out to him that he was to
            bear himself bravely, and commended him to St. George, who slew
            the dragon.  When he had just got to the top, and the owl
            perceived that he had designs on her, and was also bewildered by
            the crowd and the shouting, and knew not how to escape, she
            rolled her eyes, ruffled her feathers, flapped her wings,
            snapped her beak, and cried, tuwhit, tuwhoo, in a harsh voice.
            Strike home.  Strike home.  Screamed the crowd outside to the
            valiant hero.  Any one who was standing where I am standing,
            answered he, would not cry, strike home.  He certainly did plant
            his foot one rung higher on the ladder, but then he began to
            tremble, and half-fainting, went back again.</p>

        <p>And now there was no one left who dared to place himself in such
            danger.  The monster, said they, has poisoned and mortally
            wounded the very strongest man among us, by snapping at him and
            just breathing on him.  Are we, too, to risk our lives.  They took
            counsel as to what they ought to do to prevent the whole town from
            being destroyed.  For a long time everything seemed to be of no
            use, but at length the burgomaster found an expedient.  My
            opinion, said he, is that we ought, out of the common purse, to
            pay for this barn, and whatsoever corn, straw, or hay it contains,
            and thus indemnify the owner, and then burn down the whole
            building and the terrible beast with it.  Thus no one will have to
            endanger his life.  This is no time for thinking of expense,
            and stinginess would be ill applied.  All agreed with him.  So
            they set fire to the barn at all four corners, and with it the
            owl was miserably burnt.  Let any one who will not believe it,
            go thither and inquire for himself.
